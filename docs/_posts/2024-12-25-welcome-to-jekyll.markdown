This app was created because I have trouble concentrating while studying. I created this app to help me take regular breaks using the pomodoro technique and it has been helpful. I hope you find it useful too!

I created this app to help everyone using it to stay focused and productive. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating and using it.

If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me. I would love to hear from you!

Happy studying and working! 🍅🚀
